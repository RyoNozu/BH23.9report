	abstract = {PathVisio is a commonly used pathway editor, visualization and analysis software. Biological pathways have been used by biologists for many years to describe the detailed steps in biological processes. Those powerful, visual representations help researchers to better understand, share and discuss knowledge. Since the first publication of PathVisio in 2008, the original paper was cited more than 170 times and PathVisio was used in many different biological studies. As an online editor PathVisio is also integrated in the community curated pathway database WikiPathways. Here we present the third version of PathVisio with the newest additions and improvements of the application. The core features of PathVisio are pathway drawing, advanced data visualization and pathway statistics. Additionally, PathVisio 3 introduces a new powerful extension systems that allows other developers to contribute additional functionality in form of plugins without changing the core application. PathVisio can be downloaded from http://www.pathvisio.org and in 2014 PathVisio 3 has been downloaded over 5,500 times. There are already more than 15 plugins available in the central plugin repository. PathVisio is a freely available, open-source tool published under the Apache 2.0 license (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). It is implemented in Java and thus runs on all major operating systems. The code repository is available at http://svn.bigcat.unimaas.nl/pathvisio. The support mailing list for users is available on https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/wikipathways-discuss and for developers on https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/wikipathways-devel.},

    abstract = {Gene expression data are exponentially accumulating; thus, the functional annotation of such sequence data from metadata is urgently required. However, life scientists have difficulty utilizing the available data due to its sheer magnitude and complicated access. We have developed a web tool for browsing reference gene expression pattern of mammalian tissues and cell lines measured using different methods, which should facilitate the reuse of the precious data archived in several public databases. The web tool is called Reference Expression dataset (RefEx), and RefEx allows users to search by the gene name, various types of IDs, chromosomal regions in genetic maps, gene family based on InterPro, gene expression patterns, or biological categories based on Gene Ontology. RefEx also provides information about genes with tissue-specific expression, and the relative gene expression values are shown as choropleth maps on 3D human body images from BodyParts3D. Combined with the newly incorporated Functional Annotation of Mammals (FANTOM) dataset, RefEx provides insight regarding the functional interpretation of unfamiliar genes. RefEx is publicly available at http://refex.dbcls.jp/.},

	abstract = {Long-read sequencing can be applied to generate very long contigs and even completely assembled genomes at relatively low cost and with minimal sample preparation. As a result, long-read sequencing platforms are becoming more popular. In this respect, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies–based long-read sequencing “nanopore" platform is becoming a widely used tool with a broad range of applications and end-users. However, the need to explore and manipulate the complex data generated by long-read sequencing platforms necessitates accompanying specialized bioinformatics platforms and tools to process the long-read data correctly. Importantly, such tools should additionally help democratize bioinformatics analysis by enabling easy access and ease-of-use solutions for researchers.The Galaxy platform provides a user-friendly interface to computational command line–based tools, handles the software dependencies, and provides refined workflows. The users do not have to possess programming experience or extended computer skills. The interface enables researchers to perform powerful bioinformatics analysis, including the assembly and analysis of short- or long-read sequence data. The newly developed “NanoGalaxy" is a Galaxy-based toolkit for analysing long-read sequencing data, which is suitable for diverse applications, including de novo genome assembly from genomic, metagenomic, and plasmid sequence reads.A range of best-practice tools and workflows for long-read sequence genome assembly has been integrated into a NanoGalaxy platform to facilitate easy access and use of bioinformatics tools for researchers. NanoGalaxy is freely available at the European Galaxy server https://nanopore.usegalaxy.eu with supporting self-learning training material available at https://training.galaxyproject.org.},

In collaboration with the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC), the DDBJ Center also provides a controlled-access database, the Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA), which archives and distributes human genotype and phenotype data, requiring authorized access. The NBDC formulates guidelines and policies for sharing human data and reviews data submission and use applications. To streamline all of the processes at NBDC and JGA, we have integrated the two systems by introducing a unified login platform with a group structure in September 2020. In addition to the public databases, the DDBJ Center provides a computer resource, the NIG supercomputer, for domestic researchers to analyze large-scale genomic data.

	abstract = {Data accumulation in public databases has resulted in extensive use of meta-analysis, a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple studies. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases. This method, including the workflow developed, represents a powerful tool for deciphering conserved networks in oxidative stress response.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Species-level genetic characterization of complex bacterial communities has important clinical applications in both diagnosis and treatment. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene has proven to be a powerful strategy for the taxonomic classification of bacteria. This study aims to improve the method for full-length 16S rRNA gene analysis using the nanopore long-read sequencer MinION™. We compared it to the conventional short-read sequencing method in both a mock bacterial community and human fecal samples.
RESULTS: We modified our existing protocol for full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing by MinION™. A new strategy for library construction with an optimized primer set overcame PCR-associated bias and enabled taxonomic classification across a broad range of bacterial species. We compared the performance of full-length and short-read 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for the characterization of human gut microbiota with a complex bacterial composition. The relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera was highly similar between full-length and short-read sequencing. At the species level, MinION™ long-read sequencing had better resolution for discriminating between members of particular taxa such as Bifidobacterium, allowing an accurate representation of the sample bacterial composition.
CONCLUSIONS: Our present microbiome study, comparing the discriminatory power of full-length and short-read sequencing, clearly illustrated the analytical advantage of sequencing the full-length 16S rRNA gene.},
